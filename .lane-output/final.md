What changed:
- Reclassified the current reliable head as `0f4df01bef956123c08e4b33c94d347484222347` from `git ls-remote`.
- Kept the verdict at `0/4` because the commit shares packaged auth source command resolution across the checked release verifier and package-smoke path, but still does not prove a production-backed auth/session lifecycle or a closed durable-journal ownership boundary on the checked release path.

Commands run:
- `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z (%z)'`
- `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/lane/reliable-executor`
- `git show --stat --oneline --no-renames --decorate=short --summary 0f4df01bef956123c08e4b33c94d347484222347`
- `sed -n '1,60p' audits/critic.md`

Push result:
- Not attempted yet

Worktree status:
- Modified tracked files: `audits/critic.md`, `.lane-output/final.md`
- Branch: `lane/cycle-20260525-mainwindows-2349/critic-current-20260526-1408...origin/lane/critic`

Next supervisor nudge:
- Keep critic narrow and only reclassify again when `reliable-executor` lands checked-path production-backed auth/session lifecycle, durable-journal ownership, or preserved-remote retry proof that reaches the release boundary.
