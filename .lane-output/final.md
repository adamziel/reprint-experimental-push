Refreshed the audit snapshot to the latest remote heads and kept the release verdict closed at `0/4`.

Changed files
- [`audits/objective-audit.md`](/home/claude/reprint-experimental-push-lanes/cycle-20260525-mainwindows-2349/independent-auditor/audits/objective-audit.md)
- [`.lane-output/final.md`](/home/claude/reprint-experimental-push-lanes/cycle-20260525-mainwindows-2349/independent-auditor/.lane-output/final.md)

Commands run
- `sed -n '1,260p' audits/objective-audit.md`
- `git status --short --branch`
- `git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --format='%(refname:short) %(objectname:short) %(committerdate:iso8601) %(subject)' refs/remotes/origin/lane | head -n 20`
- `git diff -- audits/objective-audit.md .lane-output/final.md`

Push result
- Pending

Worktree status
- Tracked state is dirty with `audits/objective-audit.md` and `.lane-output/final.md`
- Branch: `lane/cycle-20260525-mainwindows-2349/independent-auditor...origin/main [ahead 1397, behind 237]`

Next supervisor nudge
- Re-poll only after a lane lands non-freshness proof that changes the live production release boundary; keep the audit verdict closed at `0/4` until then.
