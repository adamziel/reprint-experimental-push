What changed:
- Reclassified the current reliable head as `6beb5ed7c74509094d831bc4247541c4b684feae` from `git ls-remote`.
- Kept the verdict at `0/4` because the commit only cleans up the release journal temp directory and still does not prove a production-backed auth/session lifecycle or a closed durable-journal ownership boundary on the checked release path.

Commands run:
- `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z (%z)'`
- `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/lane/reliable-executor`

Push result:
- Not attempted yet

Worktree status:
- Modified tracked files: `audits/critic.md`, `.lane-output/final.md`
- Branch: `lane/cycle-20260525-mainwindows-2349/critic-current-20260526-1408...origin/lane/critic`

Next supervisor nudge:
- Keep critic narrow and only reclassify again when `reliable-executor` lands checked-path production-backed auth/session lifecycle, durable-journal ownership, or preserved-remote retry proof that reaches the release boundary.
