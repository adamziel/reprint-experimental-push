# Supervisor Feedback

Last updated: 2026-05-24

This is the short feedback loop for the supervisor. Keep it focused on what
changed, what is helping, what is not helping, and the next nudge.

## 2026-05-24

### Going Well

- No-data-loss recovery evidence improved: DB stale-claim retry now has a
  local Playground proof, and fixture upload file update/create/delete writes
  now fail closed at the storage boundary.
- The lab now has clearer replay behavior: same key/body replays without fresh
  mutation work; same key/different body conflicts before mutation.
- The project status page is shorter and links out to detailed evidence instead
  of embedding the full audit in the first view.

### Not Going Well

- The work is still lab-scoped. There is no production Reprint HTTP mutation
  endpoint, production auth binding, production DB journal, or production
  filesystem durability proof.
- Plugin data remains fixture/allowlist-scoped. Arbitrary serialized options,
  plugin tables, activation hooks, and rollback are not solved.
- The progress surface was too verbose; future updates should add links and
  one-line deltas, not long proof paragraphs.

### Progress Delta

| Lane | Direction | Nudge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No-data-loss recovery | Up | Keep expanding crash-boundary tests from lab hooks toward production-style WordPress writes. |
| Reliable executor | Flat | Next useful proof is a real source-site mutation endpoint with production-shaped auth and journal records. |
| Fast paths | Flat | Do not optimize until chunking keeps receipts, preconditions, and recovery cursors intact. |
| Plugin data | Flat | Add one realistic plugin validator/driver beyond the forms fixture before claiming semantic safety. |
| Progress publisher | Up | Keep the HTML page concise; put detailed evidence in Markdown docs. |

### Next Supervisor Nudge

Prioritize a production-shaped source-site mutation slice: authenticated
preflight, dry-run receipt, one guarded DB row update, one guarded file write,
DB journal evidence, and replay/conflict behavior over a real local WordPress
site. Keep the scope small, but make the boundary production-shaped.
